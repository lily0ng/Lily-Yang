##  **Core Principles**

**1. The Root’s Decree is Final**  

The Server Owner (Lily Yang) and Organizational Founder hold absolute authority. Their decision is final, unquestionable, and binding.

**2. No Lying to the Syndicate**  

Deception, misinformation, or lying to members within the Syndicate is strictly forbidden. Integrity within the network is mandatory.

**3. Zero External Traces**  

Screenshots, recordings, or sharing internal discussions outside the Syndicate are strictly prohibited. All communications are confidential.

**4. Operational Silence**  

Active or planned operations must never be discussed in public channels. All strategic conversations occur in secure, private sessions.

**5. No Adversaries Allowed**  

Law enforcement, intelligence agents, journalists, or other hostile entities are forbidden. Discovery results in immediate removal without warning.

##  **Access & Trust**

**6. Access is Tiered**  

Lower tiers (Bozzer, Echo) have restricted access. Advancement is granted only through proven skill, trustworthiness, and contribution.

**7. Internal Trust is Absolute**  

No scamming, fraud, betrayal, or internal exploitation is tolerated. The Syndicate is a secure zone; violations are met with permanent expulsion.

**8. No Exploitation of the Vulnerable**  

Any content or activity involving the abuse of children or vulnerable individuals is strictly forbidden and will be reported immediately.

##  **Operational & Personal Responsibility**

**10. You Are Your Own Firewall**  

Every member is solely responsible for their operational security, anonymity, and legal consequences. The Syndicate is not liable for individual mistakes.

**11. Comply with Local Laws**  

Members must comply with laws applicable in their region. The Syndicate does not endorse illegal activities, though operational discretion may vary.

**12. You Own Your Actions**  

Members operate independently. No prior approval from The Root is required, but all actions are taken at the member’s own risk and responsibility.

**13. Individual Responsibility**  

Every member is accountable for their decisions and the outcomes of their actions. Excuses are not accepted.

**14. Military, Political, and Unjust Matters**  
Handling military, political, or ethically ambiguous operations is at the sole discretion of The Root. Assistance may be provided only when deemed necessary.

##  **Security & Conduct**

**15. No Real Data**  

Do not use real personal information, addresses, phone numbers, or identifying details. Protect your identity and digital footprint.

**16. Communications Protocol**  

All official communications must be clear, concise, and free from ambiguity. Miscommunication can endanger operations and will not be tolerated.

**17. Zero Tolerance for Betrayal**  

Any form of sabotage, internal betrayal, or intentional disruption of operations results in permanent expulsion and potential reporting to external authorities if necessary.

**18. Operational Readiness**  

Members must maintain readiness, vigilance, and the ability to execute operations with precision. Complacency is a liability.

**19. Digital Hygiene**  

Use secure devices, encrypted communication channels, and routinely update operational security measures. Compromise due to negligence is unacceptable.

Every action, conversation, and operation must be conducted with discretion. Exposure or recklessness is punishable by removal.
