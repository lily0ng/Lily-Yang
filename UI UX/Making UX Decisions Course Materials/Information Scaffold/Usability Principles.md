Jakob Nielsen is a usability researcher who proposes a set of 10 usability heuristics, or general principles, for designing user-friendly interfaces. These principles provide you with a starting point for creating interfaces that are easy to use and understand.

| Principle | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Keep users informed | The system should always let users know what is happening and provide feedback within a reasonable amount of time. |
| Use familiar language | The system should use words and concepts that are familiar to users, rather than technical terms. It should also follow real-world conventions in the way it presents information. |
| Give users control | Users should be able to easily undo or redo actions, and have a clear way to exit unwanted states. |
| Be consistent | Users shouldn't have to wonder if different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. The system should follow standard conventions. |
| Prevent errors | The system should be designed to avoid errors whenever possible, or at least confirm with users before they make mistakes. |
| Make information easy to find | The system should make it easy for users to access the information they need, and shouldn't require them to remember information from one part of the interface to another. |
| Be efficient | The system should allow experienced users to work more quickly, but also be easy for inexperienced users to use. It should allow users to customize frequent actions. |
| Keep the design simple | The interface should only contain necessary information and not be cluttered with unnecessary details. |
| Help users fix errors | Error messages should be clear, explain the problem, and suggest a solution. |
| Provide help | If necessary, the system should provide clear and helpful documentation that is easy to search and focused on the tasks users need to complete. |
