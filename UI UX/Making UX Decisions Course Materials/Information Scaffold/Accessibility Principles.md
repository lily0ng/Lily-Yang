The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium, the main international standards organization for the Internet.

This reference defines “POUR”, the four web accessibility principles that they were founded on.

| Principle | Guidelines |
| --- | --- |
| Perceivable information and user interfaces | • Provide text alternatives for non-text content • Provide captions, transcripts and other alternatives for multimedia • User can change the presentation of content • Content should be easier to see and hear |
| Operable user interface and navigation | • Make sure users can interact with UI from a keyboard • Make sure users have enough time to read and use the content • Content shouldn’t cause seizures and physical reactions • Make sure users can easily navigate and find content • Make sure users can use different input modalities beyond keyboard |
| Understandable information and user interface | • Text and UI must be readable and understandable • Content and UI must appear and operate in predictable ways • Users must be helped to avoid and correct mistakes |
| Robust content and reliable interpretation | • Content must be compatible with different browsers and assistive technologies • Markup should be valid |
