#### Objective

Differentiate between scenarios suitable for warp-speed and mine-sweeper approaches.

#### Exercise

💡

Additional notes:

This exercise helps you apply the Eisenhower matrix to real-world design scenarios

Focus on justifying your decisions based on the principles we've discussed

Remember, there are no absolutely right or wrong answers - the goal is to practice your decision-making process

## Instructions

Open the FigJam template with the modified Eisenhower matrix.

For each scenario, consider the level of clarity and risk involved.

Drag and place each scenario card on the appropriate quadrant of the matrix.

In the provided area, briefly justify your placement for each scenario.

## Completion criteria

All 5 scenarios are placed on the matrix

Justification is provided for each placement
