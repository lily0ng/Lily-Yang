#### Objective

Practice using the decisioning workflow in a real-world scenario.

#### Exercise

Given a specific UI challenge for Cluster (e.g., designing the AI content suggestion workflow), walk through your decisioning workflow and document your process.

💡

Additional notes:

Be specific about what information you would seek at each step

Consider how time constraints might affect your process in a real-world scenario

Think about how this process could be streamlined for future, similar decisions

## UI challenge for Cluster: Designing the AI content suggestion interface

#### Background:

#### Challenge:

Design the interface for presenting AI-generated content suggestions to users. The interface should be intuitive, non-intrusive, and seamlessly integrated into the existing content creation workflow. It needs to present suggestions in a way that inspires creativity without overwhelming the user.

#### Key Considerations:

How and when should suggestions be presented to the user?

How many suggestions should be shown at once?

How can users interact with these suggestions (e.g., save for later, dismiss, refine)?

How should the AI's confidence level in each suggestion be communicated?

How can we integrate this feature without disrupting the existing content creation interface?

#### Constraints:

The feature needs to be implemented within the next 4 weeks to meet a product launch deadline.

Initial user research suggests that users are excited about AI assistance but are concerned about maintaining their unique voice and style.

The engineering team has expressed concerns about the performance impact of real-time AI suggestions.

Your task is to apply your decisioning workflow to this challenge and arrive at a design decision for the AI Content Suggestion interface. Document your process, justify your decisions, and identify areas for further research or validation.

## Primary design decisions

As you work through the decisioning workflow, document the process that lead to your decisions

📝

## Justifications

For each decision, explain your rationale - referencing specific user insights, data, or requirements that influenced your choice. How did the constraints impact your decisions?

📝

## Further research/validation

Identify any areas that may require further research or validation. Think about aspects of your decisions that are based on assumptions or incomplete information

📝

## Completion criteria

All steps of your decisioning workflow are documented

Your decision is clearly stated and justified

You've identified at least one area for further research or validation
